# AT Token Trading Guide for Patients

## 📘 Introduction

This guide explains how AT (Asset Token) trading works in simple terms, how profits are generated, and how your tokens remain safe throughout the process.

---

## 🎯 What is AT Token Trading?

**Simple Explanation:**  
Think of AT tokens like gold coins you own. Instead of keeping them locked in a safe earning nothing, you allow the hospital to invest them in safe, profitable businesses. The hospital shares the profits with you while keeping your tokens completely safe.

---

## 💰 How Do You Get AT Tokens?

There are **two ways** to get AT tokens:

### Method 1: Asset Deposit (Gold/Silver)
You deposit physical gold or silver with the hospital.

**Example:**
- You deposit: **10 grams of gold**
- Current gold rate: **15,000 PKR per gram**
- Total value: **10 × 15,000 = 150,000 PKR**
- AT tokens you receive: **150,000 ÷ 100 = 1,500 AT**

**Conversion Rule:** 1 AT Token = 100 PKR

### Method 2: Monthly Subscription
You pay a monthly subscription for healthcare services.

**Example:**
- Monthly subscription: **10,000 PKR**
- AT tokens you receive: **10,000 ÷ 100 = 100 AT per month**
- After 1 year: **100 × 12 = 1,200 AT**

---

## 🏦 Two Trading Pools Explained

Your AT tokens are invested in one of two pools depending on their source:

### 🟡 Asset Pool (For Gold/Silver Deposits)
- **APY (Annual Percentage Yield):** 12.5%
- **Risk Level:** Very Low
- **Investment Type:** Real estate, secured bonds, medical equipment leasing

### 🟢 Subscription Pool (For Monthly Payments)
- **APY (Annual Percentage Yield):** 8.2%
- **Risk Level:** Very Low

## 🏢 How Does the Hospital Earn These Profits?

### The Hospital's Role as Investment Manager

**Think of the hospital as a smart money manager.** When you give your AT tokens for trading, the hospital pools together money from many patients and invests it in profitable, safe businesses. Let's see exactly how this works:

---

### 🟡 Asset Pool Investments (12.5% APY)

The hospital takes the cash value of your gold/silver-backed AT tokens and invests in three main areas:

#### 1️⃣ Real Estate Investment (40% of pool)

**How It Works:**
- Hospital buys commercial properties (medical plazas, clinics, pharmacies)
- Rents them out to doctors, labs, and medical businesses
- Collects monthly rent

**Real Example:**
- Hospital has: **10 million PKR from patients' AT tokens**
- Invests 40% = **4 million PKR in a medical plaza**
- Monthly rent collected: **60,000 PKR/month**
- Annual rent: 60,000 × 12 = **720,000 PKR**
- Return rate: (720,000 ÷ 4,000,000) × 100 = **18% per year**

**Why It's Safe:**
- Hospital owns the physical property
- Always in demand (medical spaces)
- Property value increases over time
- Multiple tenants = stable income

---

#### 2️⃣ Secured Bonds (35% of pool)

**How It Works:**
- Hospital lends money to government or large corporations
- They pay interest every 6 months
- Principal returned at maturity

**Real Example:**
- Hospital invests: **3.5 million PKR in government bonds**
- Interest rate: **10% per year**
- Semi-annual interest: 3,500,000 × 5% = **175,000 PKR (every 6 months)**
- Annual interest: **350,000 PKR**
- Return rate: **10% per year**

**Why It's Safe:**
- Government-backed (very low default risk)
- Fixed returns guaranteed
- Can be sold anytime if needed
- Rated AAA by credit agencies

---

#### 3️⃣ Medical Equipment Leasing (25% of pool)

**How It Works:**
- Hospital buys expensive medical equipment (MRI machines, CT scanners, dialysis machines)
- Leases them to smaller hospitals/clinics that can't afford to buy
- Collects monthly lease payments

**Real Example:**
- Hospital buys: **MRI machine for 2.5 million PKR**
- Leases to 3 small clinics
- Each clinic pays: **25,000 PKR/month**
- Total monthly income: 75,000 PKR
- Annual income: 75,000 × 12 = **900,000 PKR**
- Return rate: (900,000 ÷ 2,500,000) × 100 = **36% per year**

**Why It's Safe:**
- Hospital owns the equipment
- High demand (all hospitals need equipment)
- Maintenance included in lease
- Equipment has resale value

**After Hospital Expenses:**
- Management costs: -2.5%
- Insurance: -1.2%
- Reserve fund: -4%
- **Net Return to Pool: 12.5%** (This goes to patients!)

---

### 🟢 Subscription Pool Investments (8.2% APY)

The hospital uses subscription money for healthcare service expansion and partnerships:

#### 1️⃣ Healthcare Services Expansion (50% of pool)

**How It Works:**
- Hospital opens new departments (physiotherapy, dental, eye clinic)
- These departments serve patients and generate revenue
- Profit comes from service fees

**Real Example:**
- Hospital invests: **5 million PKR to open dental clinic**
- Clinic serves: **40 patients/day**
- Average charge per patient: **2,000 PKR**

- Monthly revenue: 80,000 × 30 = **2,400,000 PKR**
- Monthly costs (staff, supplies): **1,800,000 PKR**
- Monthly profit: 2,400,000 - 1,800,000 = **600,000 PKR**
- Annual profit: 600,000 × 12 = **7,200,000 PKR**
- Return rate: (7,200,000 ÷ 5,000,000) × 100 = **144% per year**

**Why It's Safe:**
- Diversified patient base
- Essential services (always in demand)
- Controlled costs
- Scalable model

---

#### 2️⃣ Pharmaceutical Partnerships (30% of pool)

- Hospital invests: **3 million PKR in pharmaceutical partnership**
- Exclusive distribution of diabetes medicines in city
- Monthly medicine sales: **500,000 PKR**
- Profit margin: **25%**
- Monthly profit: 500,000 × 25% = **125,000 PKR**
- Annual profit: 125,000 × 12 = **1,500,000 PKR**
- Return rate: (1,500,000 ÷ 3,000,000) × 100 = **50% per year**

**Why It's Safe:**
- Partnership with established pharma company
- Chronic disease medicines (recurring demand)
- Exclusive territory rights
- Regulated industry

---

#### 3️⃣ Telemedicine Platform (20% of pool)

**How It Works:**
- Hospital develops online consultation platform
- Patients pay for video consultations
- Doctors earn, hospital takes platform fee

**Real Example:**
- Hospital invests: **2 million PKR in telemedicine platform**
- Monthly consultations: **1,000 consultations**
- Fee per consultation: **800 PKR**
- Hospital's platform fee: **30%**
- Monthly revenue: 1,000 × 800 × 30% = **240,000 PKR**
- Platform maintenance: **100,000 PKR/month**
- Monthly profit: 240,000 - 100,000 = **140,000 PKR**
- Annual profit: 140,000 × 12 = **1,680,000 PKR**
- Return rate: (1,680,000 ÷ 2,000,000) × 100 = **84% per year**

**Why It's Safe:**
- Low overhead (digital platform)
- Growing market (online healthcare)
- Multiple revenue streams
- Recurring users

## 📈 Profit Distribution

### How Profits Are Calculated

**Daily Basis:**

Daily Return = (Annual APY ÷ 365) × Token Value
```

**Example:**
- Your AT tokens: 1,000 AT
- Token value: 100,000 PKR
- Asset Pool APY: 12.5%
- Daily return: (12.5% ÷ 365) × 100,000 = **34.25 PKR/day**

### Profit Sharing Model

The hospital keeps a **management fee** and shares the rest with you:

| Pool Type | Your Share | Hospital Fee |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Asset Pool | 80% | 20% |
| Subscription Pool | 75% | 25% |

**Example Calculation:**
- Total profit earned: **10,000 PKR**
- Asset Pool (80/20 split):
  - Your profit: 10,000 × 80% = **8,000 PKR**
  - Hospital fee: 10,000 × 20% = **2,000 PKR**
